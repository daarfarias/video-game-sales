# video-game-sales
Description:

"Motivated by Gregory Smith's web scrape of VGChartz Video Games Sales, this data set simply extends the number of variables with another web scrape from Metacritic. Unfortunately, there are missing observations as Metacritic only covers a subset of the platforms. Also, a game may not have all the observations of the additional variables discussed below. Complete cases are ~ 6,900"(Kaggle)

The aim of the project was to present an exploratory analysis of video game sales. We examined which games were the most sold in Japan, Europe, etc. As well as what are the best-selling games on the main platforms.
